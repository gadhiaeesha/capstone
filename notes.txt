features:

- should have a menu in far left which allows user to access additional features like settings, folders, etc

- should display app name in center

- should have user in far right which allows user to sign in/sign out (account stuff will be added in a later feature)

- POTENTIAL ONLY: instead of displaying all uploaded sheet music in homepage,
maybe display most recently viewed music and have recommendations for new music 
based on uploaded music -> would need to use an api and access a library
of sheet music, but it might be worth it

Uploaded Images/Containers:

- when an image is selected from gallery, it should upload to backend, 
frontend refreshes by fetching data from backend, the new image is
added to the myImages list with the id provided by backend.
